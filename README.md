## Introduction

This repository contains a plugin to connect eBPF/BCC Python modules
to Performance Co-Pilot performance framework/toolkit to provide a
unified interface and advanced tools for processing BPF/BCC data.

## eBPF

From https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/ebpf-and-systems-performance:

> eBPF is a weird Linux kernel technology that powers low-overhead custom analysis tools, which can be run in production to find performance wins that no other tool can. With it, we can pull out millions of new metrics from the kernel and applications, and explore running software like never before. Itâ€™s a superpower.

## BCC

From https://github.com/iovisor/bcc:

> BCC is a toolkit for creating efficient kernel tracing and manipulation programs, and includes several useful tools and examples. It makes use of extended BPF (Berkeley Packet Filters), formally known as eBPF, a new feature that was first added to Linux 3.15. Much of what BCC uses requires Linux 4.1 and above.

> BCC makes BPF programs easier to write, with kernel instrumentation in C (and includes a C wrapper around LLVM), and front-ends in Python and lua. It is suited for many tasks, including performance analysis and network traffic control.

## PCP

> The Performance Co-Pilot (PCP, http://www.pcp.io/) system is a toolkit for collecting, archiving, and processing performance metrics from multiple operating systems. A typical Linux PCP installation offers over 1,000 metrics by default and is in turn extensible with its own plugins, or PMDAs ("Performance Metrics Domain Agents"). In addition to very complete /proc based statistics, readily available PCP PMDAs provide support for such system and application level components as 389 Directory Server, Apache, Ceph, containers, GFS2, Gluster, HAProxy, Java, libvirt, MySQL, NFS, Oracle, Postfix, PostgreSQL, Samba, and Sendmail, among others.

## Problem to Solve

While BCC has made creating new BPF programs easier and the BCC project 
offers a wide variety of such tools (https://github.com/iovisor/bcc), 
basically all these programs are individual, disjoint utilities that are 
mostly meant for interactive use. This is not a suitable approach to 
collect, monitor and analyse performance data in larger environments 
where there are hundreds, if not thousands, installations and where 
human intervention is infeasible at best.

While PCP offers a unified interface to a great number of performance 
metrics, advanced command line utilities for analysing live or archived 
metrics (e.g., http://pcp.io/man/man1/pmrep.1.html), and exporters to 
external systems like 
[Elasticsearch](http://pcp.io/man/man1/pcp2elasticsearch.1.html), 
[Graphite](http://pcp.io/man/man1/pcp2graphite.1.html), and 
[Zabbix](http://pcp.io/man/man1/pcp2zabbix.1.html), it lacks the ability
to directly connect to performance metric data sources like eBPF/BCC for
efficient kernel tracing programs.

There is a need to connect eBPF/BCC programs to a unified performance 
metrics framework like PCP. There is a need to connect PCP easily to a
kernel tracing toolkit like eBPF/BCC.

## Solution

PCP BCC PMDA is a plugin which extracts live performance data from eBPF 
programs by using the BCC (BPF Compiler Collection) Python frontend and 
provides them to any PCP client for archiving, monitoring, exporting, 
and analysis purposes. It loads and acts as a bridge for any number of 
configured, separate BCC Python modules embedding BPF code. Existing BCC 
Python tools and modules should be possible to convert as PCP BCC PMDA 
modules with reasonable effort.

Initially, three BCC programs have been converted to be used by PCP:

* [pidpersec](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/tools/pidpersec.py)
as [sysfork.py](modules/sysfork.py)
  * Merely a simple Hello World type minimalistic example which provides
    one single metric (which in itself is not interesting as PCP already
    provides the same metric as part of its [proc metrics](http://pcp.io/man/man1/pmdaproc.1.html)
    as _kernel.all.sysfork_.
* [biotop](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/tools/biotop.py)
as [biotop.py](modules/biotop.py)
  * Provides block device I/O information by process.
* [tcplife](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/tools/tcplife.py)
as [tcplife.py](modules/tcplife.py)
  * Provide per-process TCP statistics.

## Screenshot

With PCP BCC PMDA _biotop_ and _tcplife_ modules enabled, create a simple
[pmrep configuration file](http://pcp.io/man/man5/pmrep.conf.5.html)
for custom performance reporting, start pmrep, and run it for 50 seconds
while running _dnf -y install libreoffice_ (PID 15751) in the background
(vdb has an ext4 fs without LVM):

## Installation

* Tested on latest Fedora 27 with:
  * bcc-tools-0.4.0-2.fc27.noarch
  * pcp-3.12.2-1.fc27.x86_64
  * pcp-system-tools-3.12.2-1.fc27.x86_64
  * python3-pcp-3.12.2-1.fc27.x86_64
* Install the required packages and start the _pmcd_ daemon:
  * yum install bcc-tools pcp pcp-system-tools python3-pcp
  * systemctl enable --now pmcd
* For a PCP Quick Guide, see:
  * http://pcp.io/docs/guide.html
* Test the setup with something trivial (e.g., mimic vmstat with pmrep):
  * pmrep -b MB :vmstat
* Put SELinux into Permissive mode (for the time being):
  * setenforce 0
* Copy this repository as a PCP BCC PMDA directory:
  * cp -r pcp-bcc-pmda /var/lib/pcp/pmdas/bcc
* Configure and enable the plugin:
  * cd /var/lib/pcp/pmdas/bcc
  * man ./pmdabcc.1
  * vi bcc.conf
  * ./Install
* Verify operation from logs and by fetching metrics data (data may not
  be instantly available on an idle system):
  * less /var/log/pcp/pmcd/bcc.log
  * less /var/log/pcp/pmcd/pmcd.log
  * pminfo -f bcc
  * pmrep bcc.proc.io.perdev
* Export and analyse:
  * pcp2{csv,json,elasticsearch,graphite,influxdb,json,xlsx,xml,zabbix}
* Enhance and extend:
  * less modules/*.py
  * vi modules/test.py

## Discussion / Open Items

* Security / accesss restrictions
  * Some of the modules may obviously provide sensitive information
    that should not be available for non-privileged users
* Current modules have migrated with a minimal effort, they may contain
  unnecessary / unhelpful portions and have not been optimized for PMDA
* Data could be transferred and stored in several ways, at least with:
  * JSON files by using the PMDA JSON
    * Requires reading and writing files on each fetch
  * PCP BCC PMDA modules store the data from BPF in memory
    * Current approach
  * Modify BPF programs to store data in readily available format
    * PCP BCC PMDA modules would not need to store no metric data
* For optimal performance a rewrite in C could be considered
  * Would lose the ease of Python for unclear gain, for now not planned
* Submit to upstream for proper inclusion as part of PCP
  * If upstream interest and no design flaws / architectural issue found
  * Use a registered PMDA code instead of the temporary 499
  * Instead of increasing PMCD timeout when compiling modules use the
    suggestions from https://github.com/performancecopilot/pcp/issues/387
* Update pcp-selinux as appropriate
* Create and migrate more modules
